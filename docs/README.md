## What is The Gambit Engine?

**The Gambit Engine** transforms the world's oldest strategy game into a **DNA-encoded, on-chain RPG** where every move is a mutation. Built on the Dojo Engine and Starknet, it introduces revolutionary mechanics that blend chess strategy with genetic evolution and zero-knowledge privacy.

## Key Features

### ⚡ Gas-Based Evolution System

**NEW**: Strategic evolution with limited gas resources:

- **10 Gas Per Game**: Each player starts with 10 gas to spend on evolution
- **Trait Costs**: Pawn (1), Knight (3), Bishop (3), Rook (5), Queen (10)
- **Strategic Choices**: Decide when to evolve and when to save gas
- **Persistent Pieces**: Evolved pieces saved to inventory for future matches

### 🧬 Genetic Logic Splicing

Powered by **Cairo** and **Dojo ECS**, the Gambit Engine reimagines piece capture:

- **Inheritance Over Elimination**: Capturing a piece triggers genetic inheritance, not simple removal
- **Trait Splicer**: Capture a Bishop with your Knight? It gains the Diagonal Leap trait
- **Provable Mutation**: All genetic shifts are calculated and verified on-chain
- **Complexity Budgets**: Balance piece power against Gas Limits for strategic depth

### 🎯 ELO Matchmaking

Skill-based matchmaking for fair games:

- **Player ELO Ratings**: From Beginner (E0) to Grandmaster (E5)
- **AI Bot Levels**: 10 bot difficulties (400-2200 ELO)
- **Fair Matches**: Automatically matched with players of similar skill
- **Persistent Stats**: Track wins, losses, and improvement over time

### 📦 Persistent Inventory

Your pieces evolve across matches:

- **On-Chain Storage**: Evolved pieces saved to your inventory
- **Upgrade Over Time**: Use pieces in multiple matches, gaining more traits
- **Rarity System**: Common → Uncommon → Rare → Epic → Legendary → Mythic
- **Deploy to Battle**: Select up to 3 evolved pieces per match

### 🌫️ The ZK-Fog (Confidential Warfare)

Introduces strategic uncertainty via **STARKs**:

- **Hidden Enchantments**: Secret abilities like "3-Square Pawn Move" remain concealed until execution
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Keep your strategies hidden while maintaining verifiability
- **Fog of War**: Traditional chess perfect information becomes dynamic uncertainty

### 👻 Verifiable AI: Ghost Pieces

Autonomous agents that move according to their own on-chain AI logic, disrupting the board and challenging players with unpredictable, provably fair strategies.
