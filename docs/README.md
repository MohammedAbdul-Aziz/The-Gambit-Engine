## What is The Gambit Engine?

**The Gambit Engine** transforms the world's oldest strategy game into a **DNA-encoded, on-chain RPG** where every move is a mutation. Built on the Dojo Engine and Starknet, it introduces revolutionary mechanics that blend chess strategy with genetic evolution and zero-knowledge privacy.

## Key Features

### 🧬 Genetic Logic Splicing

Powered by **Cairo** and **Dojo ECS**, the Gambit Engine reimagines piece capture:

- **Inheritance Over Elimination**: Capturing a piece triggers genetic inheritance, not simple removal
- **Trait Splicer**: Capture a Bishop with your Knight? It gains the Diagonal Leap trait
- **Provable Mutation**: All genetic shifts are calculated and verified on-chain
- **Complexity Budgets**: Balance piece power against Gas Limits for strategic depth

### 🌫️ The ZK-Fog (Confidential Warfare)

Introduces strategic uncertainty via **STARKs**:

- **Hidden Enchantments**: Secret abilities like "3-Square Pawn Move" remain concealed until execution
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Keep your strategies hidden while maintaining verifiability
- **Fog of War**: Traditional chess perfect information becomes dynamic uncertainty

### 👻 Verifiable AI: Ghost Pieces

Autonomous agents that move according to their own on-chain AI logic, disrupting the board and challenging players with unpredictable, provably fair strategies.
